At MakerGhat, we firmly believe that the best people to address challenges for communities are those from these communities. Unfortunately, historical inequalities have made it challenging for underserved communities to be heard and obtain the resources they need for societal change. MakerGhat creates safe and open community spaces equipped with resources and mentors. Our goal is to facilitate social and economic change at the hyperlocal level by supporting the creation of community leaders. Over time, we will evolve into an incubator for projects, enabling youth to launch social and commercial enterprises that empower their communities.
