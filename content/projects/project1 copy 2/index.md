## Session Overview:
Have you ever wondered what a parachute and an open rain jacket have in common? They both trap air and slow you down when you move fast! In this activity, you design a parachute for a miniature action figure. Tissue paper or a plastic bag and a few strings is all it takes to make your figure into an expert skydiver.

## Session Objectives:
Students will be able to:
1. Adopt techniques for designing a parachute that falls slowly.
2. Determine which type of material works best by testing different options.
3. Understand how air resistance plays a role in flight.
